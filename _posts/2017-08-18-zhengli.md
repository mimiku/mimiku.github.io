Prologue

I heard a whistling sound. It was close by, and I heard it every time I heaved my chest. So I knew that it was not the wind, but a sound coming from me. 

啸声萦绕在耳际。
我总能在胸口起伏的时候，听到它。
所以我知道，那并不是风声，而是从我身上发出的声音。

This room is so cold, so dark. Ah, hadn’t I lied upon this cold floor in this same way before? I closed my eyes with the thought. Tears, blood, I know not which, ran down my cheeks. 

这间房子太冷了，太暗了。
呵，我之前不也是如现今这般躺在冰冷的地板上么？
如此想着，我闭上了眼。
泪水，鲜血，顺着我的脸颊静静淌落。

A powerful wind blew in through the window. 
I heard the pages of a diary on the desk flipping. 
It was my diary. 
A red-bound book in which everything about me was written. I could remember all of it, just as easily if it had only happened yesterday. 

一阵强风吹入屋内。
我听见书桌上日记本书页翻飞的声音。
那是我的日记。
记载着关于我的一切，一本绯红色的书。
我记得里面所有的内容，好似一切都发生在昨日。

Though I’d never written in it, I knew what was said in that diary. 

我知道日记里写了什么。

尽管，我从没在里面，写过一个字。
